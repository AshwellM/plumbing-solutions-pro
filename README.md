## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended)
Upload all files to any static hosting provider:
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the entire folder
- **Vercel**: Connect to Git repository or upload folder
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to GitHub repository and enable Pages
- **AWS S3**: Upload files and configure for static website hosting

### Option 2: Traditional Web Hosting
1. Upload all files to your web hosting provider's public_html or www folder
2. Ensure the domain points to the folder containing index.html
3. Update the canonical URL and sitemap URLs to match your domain

### Option 3: Content Delivery Network (CDN)
For optimal performance, consider using a CDN like Cloudflare in front of your hosting.
